Routes pattern suggested
---------
*The templates follow certain patterns to tell different spa apart when created in child window.*

After introducing [react-openfin] and [react-openfin-mat-impl] initially and show how to initialize them, it has been clear 
that, internal routing should very important and better fellow a common pattern to avoid ambiguity. 

> App developer doesnt have to follow this pattern. 

> But the templates provided and all blank project generated by [openfin-js-cli] will fellow this suggested pattern. 

### [Dashboard (Main window)](https://github.com/openfin-js-app/openfin-react-concise/blob/master/src/routes/Dashboard.ts) 

`Path = /dashboard/*`

**Contains all the main window views.**

All the sub view need to be render upon main window should be defined beneath this path. For simplicity, we inherit the name 
call it dashboard and dashboard views

### [Child Windows](https://github.com/openfin-js-app/openfin-react-concise/blob/master/src/routes/ChildWindow.ts)

`Path = /childWindow/*`

**Contains all the child window views.**

All the views wanna rendered in an independent window alone other than main view, should be beneath this path.  

### [Notification Windows](https://github.com/openfin-js-app/openfin-react-concise/blob/master/src/routes/notification.ts)

`Path = /notification/*`

**Contains all the notification views**

Notification window is a special kind of fixed-size window provided by the [Openfin]. It is used and could pop up independently and 
attract users attention. Moreover, the notification can send msg and communicate with its creator basing on users' acitons.

Therefore, the path `notification` is also reserved for them.
